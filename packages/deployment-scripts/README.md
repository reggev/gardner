# `@gardner/deployment-scripts`

This package contains a few startup scripts for each docker
Gardner eventually runs on a raspberry pi with an arm processor. Thus it cannot run docker-compose.
Also, Kubernetes is an overkill for such a simple deployment.

## Usage

```
const deploymentScripts = require('@gardner/deployment-scripts');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```
